I was just chilling with my fellow Squirtle Squad buddies in our nice cool pond, polishing our cool squirtle sunglasses. Suddenly we saw big plumes of scary black smoke coming from the nearby forest! A wildfire had broken out, and it looked really bad. Flames were spreading fast!

## The firefighting Squirtle Squad

"Guys, it's go time!" I said to my squad friends. We're kind of a local firefighting team here - whenever there's a forest emergency, we gear up to handle it! So we leapt into action, pulling on some protective helmets and grabbing our handy water hoses.

## Water gun

Racing through the burning trees, I felt superhot air all around me. We had to put this fire out fast or our whole forest could go up in smoke! When we got to the raging fire, I took charge. "Alright team, let's hit those flames hard! Water gun go!"

## Battling blazes as a team

We sprayed as hard we could, shooting water jets in all directions. Steam hissed as flames shrank under the deluge. Yes! It was working! "Don't let up Squad, keep it going! Rotating spray pattern Delta!" My team responded instantly to my call, moving smoothly into our practiced formation. No fire is a match for coordinated teamwork!

## Another heroic day!

The blaze fought hard but finally flickered into smoke and darkness. We'd saved our home! The forest was still standing thanks to our blue justice. As we marched back triumphant to our pond, I knew the Squirtle Squad would always be there to protect our home when danger strikes! This is just another heroic day's work for us cool water warrior pokemon!
