We arrived at Cinnabar Island for Ash's next gym battle. The battlefield was a bubbling volcano surrounded by rocks and lava - yikes! Then Blaine sent out his powerhouse Pok√©mon...the legendary fire hound Arcanine! I shuddered as it roared flames.

## Battling Arcanine

"You've got this Squirtle!" encouraged Ash, choosing me first. I faced the towering Arcanine and activated my water weapons - it was searing hot already!

Arcanine's Flamethrower scorched the air as I barely withdrew into my shell in time. The heat was blistering! I burst back out and blasted it with my strongest Hydro Pump ever. Arcanine howled as it tumbled backwards. Yes! Direct hit!

## Water and Fire

We battled fiercely, water on fire. Arcanine kept unleashing flaming attacks but I countered with liquid fists. "Go Squirtle go!" cheered Ash. I rallied my strength, walking through fire to finally tackle that giant dog into a sizzling lava pool. Arcanine sank with a defeated yelp! We did it!

## Victory!

The rest was a water-drenched blur. I quenched every pokemon Blaine threw out until the battle cooled. We'd won Ash the Volcano badge! As Ash hugged and praised me after, I smiled proudly through smoke and sweat - together we make an unbeatable team against ANY inferno!
