Hey everyone, Pikachu guest blogging today! Let me tell you about the crazy times me and Squirtle had exploring the Mt. Moon caves on the way to Cerulean City. Talk about intense!

## The moon stones

At first we were digging the scenery - glittering rocks and moon stones all around. Squirtle was making up funny super hero stories. But then things got dark fast! We got lost and all these angry Zubat started swarming us, like hundreds of 'em!

## Confusion?!

I gotta admit, their supersonic waves had me totally confused at first. Me and Squirtle were stumbling around while Zubat dived at us. But we got our focus back quick! Squirtle and I stood back-to-back - time to get to work!

## Defeating the wild Zubats

We battled fiercely, blasting away with thundershock and water gun combos. Zubat kept coming but we handled it together! Eventually the last Zubat fluttered off down the tunnel. We found the exit right after that, trading big victory high-fives!

When we told Ash, he just nodded like "yup, classic adventure for you two!" Haha! So maybe Zubat were just guarding their nests. Either way, Squirtle and I make an electrifying team! More exciting tales next time!
